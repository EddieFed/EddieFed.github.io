<h1 id="b" class="a">I'm Eddie Federmeyer</h1>
<h2 class="center" >I see you found the page about me!</h2>

<br><br>
<p> Here are a couple things you may not have known about me!
    <br><br><br>
    • I'm part of <a class="v" href="//www.Troop496.com">Boy scout Troop 496</a>, in the troop i go camping once or twice a
    month! I currently have set a record for our troop for going over 36 months in a row of camping (ive gone camping once
    a month for the past 36+ months), I dont plan on ending that streak soon. i have been through weather as gorgeous as spring weather or as horrible as -29°F.
    <br><br><br>
    • Music is a huge part of my life, my cousin is a DJ and is going to school in california to learn more about the music arts,
    it's because of him i got my loe for music. Not only that but my dad has 9 guitars and 3 pianos and a drum-set in out basement
    that he uses almost everyday. Not only that but i love to listen to <a class="v" href="http://www.spotify.com">Spotify</a> all the time!
    <br><br><br>
    • My <a class="v" href="Lilly.html">mom</a> decided one day that we should start watching some old movies as a family, now we watch movies like
    <a class="v" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113957/">The Net</a> or <a class="v" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120789/">Pleasantville</a>,
    every couple days and critique them.
