<h2 class="center" >I see you found the page about me!</h2>

<br><br>
<p> Here are a couple things you may not have known about me!
    <br><br><br>
    • Just like <a class="v" href="Ed.html">Ed</a>, i also graduated from <a class="v" href="http://web.iit.edu/">The Illinois Institute of Technology</a>.
    I have a degree in software engineering, not computer science. There is a big difference.
    <br><br><br>
    • I currently an just a stay home mom, but when I was in college, i worked at <a class="v" href="http://www.motorola.com/us/home">Motorola</a> for a couple years.
    <br><br><br>
    • As for other things i do, i am a big part of the <a class="v" href="//www.Troop496.com">Boy scouts Troop 496</a> Committee, i am the person in charge
    of getting permits and managing camping locations. I'm also going to become the advancement chair, the person in charge of keeping track of
    the boy's ranks.
